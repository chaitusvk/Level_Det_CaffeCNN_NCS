2. Project_Source_Code has all files for the project, read internal ReadMe to understand functions of each code.

3. Caffe files has the required Caffe CNN files. 

4. Caffe model and solver state are compressed and split with 7z compression to accomodate in GitHub.

5. To install Caffe follow steps as in Caffe install steps document by Durvesh Pathak of IUPUI.

6. To install NCS packages refer report documentation.

7. Components used :
a. Intel Neural Compute Stick and NCSDK
b. GoPro Hero 4 Camera and GoPro Py API's
c. Raspberry Pi 3 
d. Test-tube setup with external lights
e. GPU powered PC for training of Caffe network weights
